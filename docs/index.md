# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Romain from Paris, France.

You've found my place where I'm exploring cool stuff like **Matter** and **Thread** technologies using **ESP** hardware.

I'm learning as I go and sharing everything I find here. If you're on a similar journey, *let's connect on GitHub!*

Just so you know, this project is **still ongoing**. You might find some things that aren't quite finished or might have mistakes. Feel free to let me know via a **GitHub issue**, or contribute by suggesting changes or adding content with a **PR**!
